## Prompt 1
Write JavaScript code that keeps prompting the player to guess a number between 1 and 10 until they get it right.

If they guess correctly, update the page with the message `🎉 Congratulations! You guessed it in {# of attempts} attempt.` and stop asking.

If their guess is too high or too low, provide a hint.

## Prompt 2
Rewrite the game using a for loop instead of a while loop, giving the player 5 attempts. 
If they guess correctly, update the page with the message `🎉 Congratulations! You guessed it in {# of attempts} attempts.` 
If they run out of attempts, display `❌ Game over! The number was {secretNumber}.`
